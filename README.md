# Chart4Delphi

Unit developed in Delphi 10.4 with Firemonkey to create pie, donnut, bar and line charts without the use of third-party components.

Bar graph: remix from https://github.com/DelphiCreative/DashBoards<br/>
Line graph: remix from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-k6HT07g88&t=1<br/>
Other graphics: own development.

Graphics are fully customizable. The values to be displayed must be passed in JSON-Array format.

### Tip: For database integration I recommend using the "DataSetSerialize" module which makes it much easier to convert queries to JSON format: https://github.com/viniciussanchez/dataset-serialize
